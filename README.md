# AltVoteKit

A basic library for Alternative vote, written in swift. A future direction is to adapt the more advanced algorithm for single transferrable votes from https://github.com/hharck/VoteViz/blob/a48b084f88733fc7eb95665770abccab0c738062/VoteViz.swiftpm/STV/STVResult.swift#L99 which allows multiple winner. Though, this version is lacking in that it is less customizable in regards to ties and not fully tested.
